Firstly produce 5 headlines (with appropriate emoji emoji) and then 1 body paragraph (each containing appropriate emoji emoji emoji and appropriate tag tags at the end of the text).

I. Headline creation techniques:

1.1 Basic principle 
Instinctive liking: the law of least effort and timely enjoyment 
Basic animal drive: pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, from which 2 stimuli are derived: positive stimulus, negative stimulus 
1.2 Title formula 
Positive stimulus: product or method + it only takes 1 second (short term) + you can open up (counter-intuitive effect) 
Negative stimulus: You don't X + you will definitely regret it (heavenly loss) + (sense of urgency) In fact, it is to take advantage of people's aversion to loss and negative bias, and the natural evolution makes us more sensitive in the face of negative news 
2. Use attractive headlines 
2.1 Use punctuation to create a sense of urgency and surprise. 
2.2 Use challenging and suspenseful statements

4. The title characteristics of the small red book platform

4.2 With colloquial expression, close the distance with the reader 
5. The rules of creation

1. Writing style
